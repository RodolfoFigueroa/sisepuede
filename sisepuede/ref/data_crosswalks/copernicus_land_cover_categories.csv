20,``shrublands``,none,0,0,Shrubs. Woody perennial plants with persistent and woody stems and without any defined main stem being less than 5 m tall. The shrub foliage can be either evergreen or deciduous.
30,``grasslands``,none,1,0,Herbaceous vegetation. Plants without persistent stem or shoots above ground and lacking definite firm structure. Tree and shrub cover is less than 10 %.
40,``croplands``,none,0,0,"Cultivated and managed vegetation / agriculture. Lands covered with temporary crops followed by harvest and a bare soil period (e.g., single and multiple cropping systems). Note that perennial woody crops will be classified as the appropriate forest or shrub land cover type."
